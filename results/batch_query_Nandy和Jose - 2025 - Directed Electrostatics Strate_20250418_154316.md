The two possible driving factors for high GP could be the (1) stability of the parent clusters and (2) favorable MESP(3,+3) CP positions. A high ΔE/n of the parent relative to its ΔEG/n of the clusters in its evolutionary path shows the cooperative changes in the geometry of the parent cluster. If

 the surroundings of the parent, Ecluster is the energy of the total cluster, Eparent is the energy of the parent cluster whose GP has to be determined, and EMg is the energy of a single atom of Mg.
Figure 6C showcases the GP of each Mgn cluster, which are the initial clusters of each path. ΔE/n of the parent clusters are represented as dotted lines connected to the ΔEG/n of each cluster evolution path. As observed in Figure 6C, Mg13(Ih) shows a linear GP and has a high ΔEG/n up to Mg137 (−0.97 eV). The linear trends in GP are also observed in Mg15(D3h), Mg17(D4d), and Mg20(C2v) but exhibit lower GP of −0.92, −0.80, and −0.85 eV for the largest cluster in the respective paths. The Mg6(Oh) and Mg4 (Td) parents exhibit a sharp increase in the GP up to specific cluster sizes, indicating that smaller parent clusters have higher GPs than the larger sizes.

 the respective paths. The Mg6(Oh) and Mg4 (Td) parents exhibit a sharp increase in the GP up to specific cluster sizes, indicating that smaller parent clusters have higher GPs than the larger sizes. The GP of Mg6 is significant up to the Mg44 (−0.83 eV) daughter cluster but gradually declines from −0.91 to −0.98 eV for the succeeding clusters, indicating an onset of saturation in the parent cluster. Similarly, Mg4 has a significant GP up to Mg54 (−0.80 eV), followed by a gradual decay in the process from −0.85 to −0.94 eV. Thus, the parent GPs exhibit their capacity to accommodate the incoming atoms, followed by an indication of the cluster size when nearing saturation. The clusters of highest point-group symmetries, Ih, Oh, and Td, have the largest GP among DESIGNN-guided paths. The least GP is observed in the Mg59D2d path, which is −0.63 eV for its largest cluster Mg145 as shown in Figure 6C.

It must be noted that the number of MESPCP(3,+3) predicted from the DESIGNN approach might be higher, given the understanding that the mere presence of a polyhedral face may give rise to several MESPCP(3,+3). However, such points can be discarded based on single-point energy calculations. The concurrence in the number of MESP topography minimum-predicted and DAMQT calculation for a given point-group symmetry and cluster size reaffirms the efficacy of the DESIGNN approach.
Role of Symmetry Conservation in the DESIGNN Approach. Wales et al.70 and Avnir et al.71 reported that the systems with high symmetry are expected to be at the extreme ends of their PES. Individually, they theorized that the global minima structures of atomic clusters will preferably acquire higher symmetry.

Figure 5 showcases the ease of generation of large metal cluster systems using the DESIGNN approach.
Structure and Energetics of DESIGNN-Guided Clusters. The interaction energy per atom of each cluster is presented in Figure 6A. The single-point energies are calculated at the 6-31+G(d,p) level of theory and are presented in Table S2 (SI). Symmetric clusters obtained during optimization are considered in the remaining analysis. A detailed comparison of energetics and structures of symmetric and local minimum clusters are reported in Table S3 (SI). As the number of atoms increases, it is expected that the binding energy per atom will increase, which determines the shape of the cluster. The binding energy accounts for all interactions in the atoms.

Over the years, several local minimum structures have been reported in the literature.74−76 The reported cluster structures were predominantly nonsymmetric, and as per the authors' knowledge, cluster structure prediction by constraining to a particular point-group symmetry is not reported.
The best-case studies of the Mgn clusters range within n ≤ 32, and, according to our knowledge, limited reports of unsymmetric clusters up to n ≤ 56 are available.76 The prediction of MESP to obtain the global minimum clusters from literature is presented in Figure S8 (SI). A series of parent clusters have been used to show that the addition of a minimal number of new atoms leads to the daughter clusters reported in the literature.

comparison of the symmetry function (G) at the MESPCP(3,+3) predicted through the DESIGNN approach (Gpredicted) and the whole cluster calculations is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4(I) depicts the MESPCP(3,+3) calculated through a whole structure calculation ( $G_{actual}$ ), and Figure 4(II) depicts the ones predicted through the DESIGNN approach. Figure 4(III) graphically compares both approaches for the structures depicted in Figure 4(I and II), respectively. For the reported clusters, the predicted DESIGNN vectors corroborate well with DAMQT vectors, with a correlation coefficient close to unity. Due to the high computational cost of evaluating MESP topography, the comparison is restricted to a small cluster size regime, n ≤ 66.

which may not indicate the accurate GP of the parent. The GP of entire clusters with respect to corresponding parents on the DESIGNN-guided path is reported in the Supporting Information (Table S7).
On considering the next daughter cluster, the individual stability of the parent cluster and the number of MESP topography minimum that can accommodate new atoms contribute to the GP value. Hence, the presence of vacant sites or oversaturation, even in the symmetric clusters, may give rise to metastable clusters. The GP of entire clusters with respect to corresponding parents on the DESIGNN-guided path is reported in the Supporting Information (Table S7).

The GNN model maps the structural information to the transformed  $\text{MESP}_{(3,+3)}^{\text{CP}}$  through radial  $(r)$  and angular( $\theta$ ) networks. Since the association is carried out using a collection of faces, the number of atoms does not hamper the prediction of  $\text{MESP}_{(3,+3)}^{\text{CP}}$  on large clusters.

 by exploring plausible structural evolution paths. The next section discusses the DESIGNN methodology, followed by method benchmark calculations in the results and discussion section.
■ METHODOLOGY
MESP is a scalar property of a molecule, and classically, it is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test positive charge from infinity to a point r.58,59 Mathematically, MESP at a point r is calculated as the sum of nuclear and electronic contributions:
$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{A} \frac{Z_{A}}{|r - R_{A}|} - \int \frac{\rho(r')}{|r - r'|} d^3 r' \tag{1}$$
The evaluation of  $V$ (r) requires the calculation of wave function or density through computationally expensive quantum chemical methods. Therefore, GNN models have recently been employed to predict electrostatic potential with high accuracy through atomic multipoles as descriptors on small molecules.60

■ METHODOLOGY
MESP is a scalar property of a molecule, and classically, it is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test positive charge from infinity to a point r.58,59 Mathematically, MESP at a point r is calculated as the sum of nuclear and electronic contributions:
$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{A} \frac{Z_{A}}{|r - R_{A}|} - \int \frac{\rho(r')}{|r - r'|} d^3 r' \tag{1}$$
The evaluation of  $V$ (r) requires the calculation of wave function or density through computationally expensive quantum chemical methods. Therefore, GNN models have recently been employed to predict electrostatic potential with high accuracy through atomic multipoles as descriptors on small molecules.60

comparison of the symmetry function (G) at the MESPCP(3,+3) predicted through the DESIGNN approach (Gpredicted) and the whole cluster calculations is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4(I) depicts the MESPCP(3,+3) calculated through a whole structure calculation ( $G_{actual}$ ), and Figure 4(II) depicts the ones predicted through the DESIGNN approach. Figure 4(III) graphically compares both approaches for the structures depicted in Figure 4(I and II), respectively. For the reported clusters, the predicted DESIGNN vectors corroborate well with DAMQT vectors, with a correlation coefficient close to unity. Due to the high computational cost of evaluating MESP topography, the comparison is restricted to a small cluster size regime, n ≤ 66.

The DESIGNN approach shows lower RMSE for cluster sizes Mg30, Mg35, and Mg40, where the extent of long-range neighborhood interactions is far more pronounced than the smaller clusters. As observed in the MLP model, the performance steadily decreases as the cluster size increases, since neighboring interactions are not well represented and no information is exchanged between atoms. However, the MLP model still maintains lower errors ( $r = \pm$  0.4 Å,  $\theta = \pm 6.0^{\circ}$ ) owing to the unique featurization of atoms.

 the respective paths. The Mg6(Oh) and Mg4 (Td) parents exhibit a sharp increase in the GP up to specific cluster sizes, indicating that smaller parent clusters have higher GPs than the larger sizes. The GP of Mg6 is significant up to the Mg44 (−0.83 eV) daughter cluster but gradually declines from −0.91 to −0.98 eV for the succeeding clusters, indicating an onset of saturation in the parent cluster. Similarly, Mg4 has a significant GP up to Mg54 (−0.80 eV), followed by a gradual decay in the process from −0.85 to −0.94 eV. Thus, the parent GPs exhibit their capacity to accommodate the incoming atoms, followed by an indication of the cluster size when nearing saturation. The clusters of highest point-group symmetries, Ih, Oh, and Td, have the largest GP among DESIGNN-guided paths. The least GP is observed in the Mg59D2d path, which is −0.63 eV for its largest cluster Mg145 as shown in Figure 6C.

Symmetric clusters obtained during optimization are considered in the remaining analysis. A detailed comparison of energetics and structures of symmetric and local minimum clusters are reported in Table S3 (SI). As the number of atoms increases, it is expected that the binding energy per atom will increase, which determines the shape of the cluster.

Input Representation and Feature Extraction. The physical and chemical properties of the chemical system under study represent the essential information corresponding to initial node attributes ( $x_{v_i}^{(t=0)}$ ) and edge attributes ( $e_{v_i,v_j}^{(t=0)}$ ). In the DESIGNN approach, the local environment of each node must be described in the context of a graph. We have described in detail the input representation of the initial cluster structure employed for training in Figure 2. Every cluster has several MESP(3,+3)CP, which must be trained as individual data sets. In such cases when the cluster geometry remains the same, data redundancy occurs, which leads to several properties being associated with the same structural representation.

Over the years, several local minimum structures have been reported in the literature.74−76 The reported cluster structures were predominantly nonsymmetric, and as per the authors' knowledge, cluster structure prediction by constraining to a particular point-group symmetry is not reported.
The best-case studies of the Mgn clusters range within n ≤ 32, and, according to our knowledge, limited reports of unsymmetric clusters up to n ≤ 56 are available.76 The prediction of MESP to obtain the global minimum clusters from literature is presented in Figure S8 (SI). A series of parent clusters have been used to show that the addition of a minimal number of new atoms leads to the daughter clusters reported in the literature.

th DAMQT vectors, with a correlation coefficient close to unity. Due to the high computational cost of evaluating MESP topography, the comparison is restricted to a small cluster size regime, n ≤ 66. It must be noted that the number of MESPCP(3,+3) predicted from the DESIGNN approach might be higher, given the understanding that the mere presence of a polyhedral face may give rise to several MESPCP(3,+3). However, such points can be discarded based on single-point energy calculations. The concurrence in the number of MESP topography minimum-predicted and DAMQT calculation for a given point-group symmetry and cluster size reaffirms the efficacy of the DESIGNN approach.
Role of Symmetry Conservation in the DESIGNN Approach. Wales et al.70 and Avnir et al.71 reported that the systems with high symmetry are expected to be at the extreme ends of their PES. Individually, they theorized that the global minima structures of atomic clusters will preferably acquire higher symmetry.

Figure 5 showcases the ease of generation of large metal cluster systems using the DESIGNN approach.
Structure and Energetics of DESIGNN-Guided Clusters. The interaction energy per atom of each cluster is presented in Figure 6A. The single-point energies are calculated at the 6-31+G(d,p) level of theory and are presented in Table S2 (SI). Symmetric clusters obtained during optimization are considered in the remaining analysis. A detailed comparison of energetics and structures of symmetric and local minimum clusters are reported in Table S3 (SI). As the number of atoms increases, it is expected that the binding energy per atom will increase, which determines the shape of the cluster. The binding energy accounts for all interactions in the atoms.

 by exploring plausible structural evolution paths. The next section discusses the DESIGNN methodology, followed by method benchmark calculations in the results and discussion section.
■ METHODOLOGY
MESP is a scalar property of a molecule, and classically, it is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test positive charge from infinity to a point r.58,59 Mathematically, MESP at a point r is calculated as the sum of nuclear and electronic contributions:
$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{A} \frac{Z_{A}}{|r - R_{A}|} - \int \frac{\rho(r')}{|r - r'|} d^3 r' \tag{1}$$
The evaluation of  $V$ (r) requires the calculation of wave function or density through computationally expensive quantum chemical methods. Therefore, GNN models have recently been employed to predict electrostatic potential with high accuracy through atomic multipoles as descriptors on small molecules.60

on the topography minima is transformed into 2D information. If x is the structural information derived for one face on the polyhedra, y is the MESP(3, + 3)CP described by a functional form y(r, θ).
The algorithm for the DESIGNN approach is presented in Figure 1. The structural information derived from the parent cluster is associated with the  $\text{MESP}_{(3,+3)}^{\text{CP}}$  through a graph transformation. The GNN model maps the structural information to the transformed  $\text{MESP}_{(3,+3)}^{\text{CP}}$  through radial  $(r)$  and angular( $\theta$ ) networks. Since the association is carried out using a collection of faces, the number of atoms does not hamper the prediction of  $\text{MESP}_{(3,+3)}^{\text{CP}}$  on large clusters.
Illustration of the GNN Model. In graph theory, chemical structure is represented as graphs, G = (V, E). Here, a set of vertices ( $v_i \in V$ ) correspond to atoms, and edges ( $e_{v_i v_j} \in E$ ) correspond to the bonds.

Figure 6C showcases the GP of each Mgn cluster, which are the initial clusters of each path. ΔE/n of the parent clusters are represented as dotted lines connected to the ΔEG/n of each cluster evolution path. As observed in Figure 6C, Mg13(Ih) shows a linear GP and has a high ΔEG/n up to Mg137 (−0.97 eV). The linear trends in GP are also observed in Mg15(D3h), Mg17(D4d), and Mg20(C2v) but exhibit lower GP of −0.92, −0.80, and −0.85 eV for the largest cluster in the respective paths. The Mg6(Oh) and Mg4 (Td) parents exhibit a sharp increase in the GP up to specific cluster sizes, indicating that smaller parent clusters have higher GPs than the larger sizes.

comparison of the symmetry function (G) at the MESPCP(3,+3) predicted through the DESIGNN approach (Gpredicted) and the whole cluster calculations is depicted in Figure 4. Figure 4(I) depicts the MESPCP(3,+3) calculated through a whole structure calculation ( $G_{actual}$ ), and Figure 4(II) depicts the ones predicted through the DESIGNN approach. Figure 4(III) graphically compares both approaches for the structures depicted in Figure 4(I and II), respectively. For the reported clusters, the predicted DESIGNN vectors corroborate well with DAMQT vectors, with a correlation coefficient close to unity. Due to the high computational cost of evaluating MESP topography, the comparison is restricted to a small cluster size regime, n ≤ 66.

operties using complete DFT calculations on an extensive database is computationally exhaustive. However, extrapolating these models provides easy access to larger and more complex chemical systems.
Recently, systematic structural exploration using quantum chemical scalar properties such as the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) has been employed to generate Lin and Agn clusters.56,57 MESP is the precise molecular property for determining the favorable site of the incoming successive atom or nucleophile. However, due to the expensive computational methods, calculations by far have been limited to  $n$  = 58 for Lin clusters and  $n$  = 20 for Agn clusters. Therefore, designing affordable theoretical approaches to build nanoclusters of specific size and point-group symmetry holds significance.

The GP of Mg6 is significant up to the Mg44 (−0.83 eV) daughter cluster but gradually declines from −0.91 to −0.98 eV for the succeeding clusters, indicating an onset of saturation in the parent cluster. Similarly, Mg4 has a significant GP up to Mg54 (−0.80 eV), followed by a gradual decay in the process from −0.85 to −0.94 eV. Thus, the parent GPs exhibit their capacity to accommodate the incoming atoms, followed by an indication of the cluster size when nearing saturation. The clusters of highest point-group symmetries, Ih, Oh, and Td, have the largest GP among DESIGNN-guided paths. The least GP is observed in the Mg59D2d path, which is −0.63 eV for its largest cluster Mg145 as shown in Figure 6C.

Input Representation and Feature Extraction. The physical and chemical properties of the chemical system under study represent the essential information corresponding to initial node attributes ( $x_{v_i}^{(t=0)}$ ) and edge attributes ( $e_{v_i,v_j}^{(t=0)}$ ). In the DESIGNN approach, the local environment of each node must be described in the context of a graph. We have described in detail the input representation of the initial cluster structure employed for training in Figure 2. Every cluster has several MESP(3,+3)CP, which must be trained as individual data sets. In such cases when the cluster geometry remains the same, data redundancy occurs, which leads to several properties being associated with the same structural representation.
