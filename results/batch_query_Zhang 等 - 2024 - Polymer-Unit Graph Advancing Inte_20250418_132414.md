cules for exploring structural characteristics. Consequently, it becomes imperative to devise simplified methods for inputting structural representations that are well-suited for polymer GNN models.
Polymers and macromolecules are often formed by a series of reactions from a number of small molecular precursors, namely, polymer-unit (also named as repeat units),35,40 in the same way that tens of thousands of English words can be formed using only 26 letters, a wide range of polymers can be generated from a limited number of polymer units through their different combinations. In 1993, Sumpter and Noid41 proposed a method of using polymer repeat units (namely, polymer-units) as nodes in neural networks (prior to the proposal of GNN), which successfully predicted nine properties for 357 different polymers with an average prediction error rate of only 3%. Thus, the effectiveness of deep learning based on polymer unit nodes is evident. Queen35 et al.

the left column shows the visualization result of the baseline
gn-exp model on OSC data, while the right column depicts the
visualization result of the PU-gn-exp model. Specifically, Figure
3b(1) illustrates the visualization result for hole mobility as the
target attribute, and Figure 3b(2) showcases the visualization
result for electron mobility as the target attribute. Here, the
utilization of the OSC Polymer-unit Graph in gn-exp has
significant implications. By incorporation of the Polymer-unit
Graph, the interpretability and visualization of MPNN are
enhanced. This is because the correlation between key
properties like carrier mobility is found to rely more
prominently on the interactions between polymer-units, rather
than on atom−level interactions. To better showcase the
improved interpretability of the PU-gn-exp model in OSC
materials, we have included additional cases in Figures S3 and

 work adopts the LRP principle, which demonstrates superior performance in test scenarios. The LRP principle aims to transform the output signal of the GNN into a linear combination of input signals. The LRP principle employed by graph-network explainability can be interpreted as a repeated Taylor decomposition, assuming that the correlation sum of each layer in the neural network remains constant. Consequently, the correlation sum of the output layer can be decomposed into the input correlation sum:
$$\sum \mathbb{R}^{(x)} = \dots = \sum \mathbb{R}^{(l)} = \dots = f(x) \tag{5}$$
The LRP principle is mainly concerned with which characteristics of the input contribute the most to the output, and it can deal with positive and negative correlations, respectively, so that the correlation between the input and the output provides more in-depth analysis. The LRP relies on back-propagation of a neural network, which involves accumulating correlations from the output to the input.

Deep learning is a data-driven scientific field that employs
algorithms to reveal hidden relationships within data sets,
offering valuable insights for experimental scientific pursuits.
For OSCs, a significant amount of literature has been
accumulated since their initial discovery in 1956,
